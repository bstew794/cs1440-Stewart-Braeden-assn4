# User Manual

Welcome user, and thank you for purchasing our Fractal Visualizer!

in this file, we will be showing you how to operate this product. The first step is to download the file into your C:\
drive; if you have not done so, then stop immediately and re-download the product there. After this, you should open
your console window and type something like this:

cd cs1440-Stewart-Braeden-assn4

and then:

python src/Main.py [FRACTAL_NAME]

With [FRACTAL_NAME] being where you type in the desired fractal you want to generate. If you leave this argument out or
type in an invalid choice, then the console will print out a message telling you that you did so and restart.

The image will then be printed to the screen; this process can take a while so please be patient as the window updates
the image line by line. If it takes longer than 5 minutes, please contact a customer service representative from
DuckieCorp. Once the full image has been display, the image will then be saved to a .png file inside of the
cs1440-Stewart-Braeden-assn4 folder.

The program will then end and you will need to type python src/Main.py [FRACTAL_NAME] again into the console for any
other fractals you want to generate.
